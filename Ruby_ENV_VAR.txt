Application for tuning Ruby GC: https://tunemygc.com/

Da codice sorgente ruby/gc.c branch master (20-11-2022):
/*
 * GC tuning environment variables
 *
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS
 *   - Initial allocation slots.
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS
 *   - Prepare at least this amount of slots after GC.
 *   - Allocate slots if there are not enough slots.
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR (new from 2.1)
 *   - Allocate slots by this factor.
 *   - (next slots number) = (current slots number) * (this factor)
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_MAX_SLOTS (new from 2.1)
 *   - Allocation rate is limited to this number of slots.
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS_MIN_RATIO (new from 2.4)
 *   - Allocate additional pages when the number of free slots is
 *     lower than the value (total_slots * (this ratio)).
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS_GOAL_RATIO (new from 2.4)
 *   - Allocate slots to satisfy this formula:
 *       free_slots = total_slots * goal_ratio
 *   - In other words, prepare (total_slots * goal_ratio) free slots.
 *   - if this value is 0.0, then use RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR directly.
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS_MAX_RATIO (new from 2.4)
 *   - Allow to free pages when the number of free slots is
 *     greater than the value (total_slots * (this ratio)).
 * * RUBY_GC_HEAP_OLDOBJECT_LIMIT_FACTOR (new from 2.1.1)
 *   - Do full GC when the number of old objects is more than R * N
 *     where R is this factor and
 *           N is the number of old objects just after last full GC.
 *
 *  * obsolete
 *    * RUBY_FREE_MIN       -> RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS (from 2.1)
 *    * RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS -> RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS (from 2.1)
 *
 * * RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT
 * * RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_MAX (new from 2.1)
 * * RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR (new from 2.1)
 *
 * * RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT (new from 2.1)
 * * RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_MAX (new from 2.1)
 * * RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR (new from 2.1)
